    # Introduction
    This API is documented in **OpenAPI format**
    It was **extended** to illustrate features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)

    OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).
